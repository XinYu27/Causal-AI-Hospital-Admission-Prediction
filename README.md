# ***Hospital Admission Prediction: A Causal AI Approach (Streamlit Application)***

## Overview

This repository contains the Streamlit application for the project "Hospital Admission Prediction: A Causal AI Approach." The app provides an interactive interface for predicting hospital admissions based on user-inputted data and displays key causal insights.

## Features

**Interactive Input**: Users can input patient attributes (e.g., age, symptoms, conditions) to get a prediction.

**Causal Insights**: Displays key factors influencing the predictions, derived from causal analysis.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive experience.
